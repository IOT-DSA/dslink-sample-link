# Dart DSLink Sample

This DSLink is based on the Example DSLink. This link is used to demonstrate how to write a
DSLink which does not use an existing engine supported by DGLux Server. This sample uses only
a bash script. A full sample would provide both a bash script, and a .bat script for windows platform.
